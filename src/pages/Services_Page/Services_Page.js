                    <p className="document-specs">
                    Most people who file bankruptcy are aware of some of the exemptions or protections available to debtors and their assets.  You may protect your home, two vehicles per person (up to $7,500 of equity – if you are over the age of 65 or disabled the limit increases), household goods and furnishings, clothing, jewelry, tools of the trade, and life insurance (if you name a spouse or child as a beneficiary).

                        <b>
                        If your car or home is secured by a loan against it, you may keep the asset only if you agree to pay that debt.  Some creditors want you to sign a document called a “Reaffirmation Agreement”.  If you do not want to repay these secured loans, you must “surrender” the home or car.  If your budget does not justify reaffirming a car or other personal property secured by a loan, the bankruptcy court may reject your Reaffirmation Agreement which could allow the creditor to repossess the item, though this is not likely if you remain current on your monthly payments.
                        </b>Surrendered secured assets, such as cars and homes, can be kept for a few weeks to a few months depending on how vigilant the creditor is.  (If you are significantly behind in your house payments and you want to keep your house, we will discuss the benefits of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to your situation, as that may be the best alternative for you).

                    Home, cars, secured debt, and Reaffirmation Agreements
                    </p>
                    <p className="document-specs">
                    You can choose whether to keep your secured assets (home, car) and keep paying back the loans that secure those assets, or you may surrender those assets and discharge the loans.  If you wish to keep a secured asset, you must remain current on the monthly payments to the creditor, or the creditor has the right to repossess or foreclose, even though you have filed bankruptcy.  You will most likely receive a document called a Reaffirmation Agreement where your lender will encourage you to sign a contract obligating you to repay the original loan under the same terms and conditions.  They will lead you to believe that you are required to sign the document to keep your car or your home.  In reality, very few creditors repossess a secured asset for failure to sign a Reaffirmation Agreement, so long as you remain current on your monthly payment.
                    </p>
                    <p className="document-specs">
                    There are advantages to refusing to sign this agreement.  The major one is that if you ever decide you do not want the secured asset in the future, due to the asset losing its value or inability to repay (or any reason), you can stop paying back the loan at any time and not be legally obligated to repay it, but you will also be required to surrender the asset to the secured creditor.  Not signing the agreement gives you some flexibility.  For example, a car loan for $10,000 on a car worth $5,000; if you were to get into a car accident, rendering the vehicle worthless, you could walk away from the remaining $10,000 loan if you never signed a Reaffirmation Agreement.  On the other hand, if you signed one, you would still be required to repay the remainder, even though you filed bankruptcy earlier.  Due to the unforeseen nature of what your circumstances will be in the future, we can never advise anyone to sign one, and yet, most of clients choose to sign one anyway.  The other draw back is that the work we perform relating a reaffirmation agreement costs on average $250 per agreement.

                    <p className="document-specs">
                    The benefits of signing a reaffirmation agreement is that you have the security of knowing that the creditor will not repossess (as unlikely as that is if you continue making monthly payments), and it may improve your credit score in the future.  It may also help you refinance loans in the future, obtain credit, and remain friendly with this particular creditor who may be willing to extend more credit to you in the future.  Sometimes your credit report will reflect that you have discharged the debt in bankruptcy, and that you are not repaying the loan if you choose NOT to sign the reaffirmation agreement, so this is perhaps the biggest benefit of choosing to sign one.  There are pros and cons each way, and if you decide you wish to sign a Reaffirmation Agreement, that is fully within your rights
